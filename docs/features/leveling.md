# Leveling: The Shared Journey

Leveling is the story of your bond. It is a measure of the time, effort, and shared experiences that connect you to your companion. As you grow, they grow with you. Every monster slain, every ore mined, and every fish caught strengthens the connection, empowering your pet to better fulfill its [Role](roles.md).

## The Echo of Experience

Your pets learn by watching you. When you gain experience, a portion of it echoes out to your nearby companions, rewarding them for being part of your journey. They don't need to land the killing blow or be actively involved, they just need to be present, within about 32 blocks.

However, the echo is not a simple, even split. It is shaped by a few key factors:

*   **A Sharper Mind:** Some pets are simply more studious. A pet's innate focus and its chosen Role can make it a faster learner, allowing it to absorb a greater share of experience from every event.
*   **Active Participation:** A pet that has recently been in combat will feel more engaged and absorb a bonus amount of experience. They learn best by doing.
*   **The Wisdom of Youth:** Younger pets are eager to learn. They receive a significant boost to experience gain in their early levels, helping them quickly find their footing and catch up to the rest of the pack.

This system ensures that while all pets grow with you, their individual journey is unique. A scholarly Support pet might level faster from quiet tasks, while a battle-hardened Striker thrives in the heat of combat.

## Rituals of Commitment

Progression is more than just a bar filling up. At key milestones in your pet's development, their journey will pause. They will look to you for a sign of your shared commitment, a ritual to acknowledge the bond you've forged together. This is a tribute.

To perform the ritual, you must present your pet with a specific, symbolic offering while sneaking. This act of devotion will unlock their milestone, allowing their growth to continue. Each Role has its own unique set of tribute offerings, defined in its datapack.

These moments are important. They are a chance to pause and recognize the journey you've shared, and to prepare for the path that lies ahead. Until the tribute is paid, your pet's progression is on hold, waiting for you to reaffirm your bond.

## The Fruits of Growth

Leveling up is a tangible reward. With each new level, your pet grows stronger. At the most significant milestones, they will unlock powerful new abilities and passive effects defined by their Role. These are moments of celebration, marking a new chapter in your companion's life and a new depth to your shared power.
