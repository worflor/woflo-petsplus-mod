# Behaviour: The Pet Answers

Your pet feels things. The world whispers to them, and their soul listens, translating signals into a storm of fleeting emotions. But that inner storm doesn't lead to chaos. It settles. It coalesces into a single, dominant **Mood** that defines their current state of being.

This document is about that answer. It’s about how your pet expresses its inner world through its actions.

## From Emotion to Mood

Think of emotions as ingredients and a mood as the resulting dish. A dash of joy from being pet, a sprinkle of curiosity from a strange sound, a lingering sense of loyalty—these feelings are constantly being blended together. Recent and intense feelings naturally have the most influence, meaning your pet lives in the moment while still being shaped by its past.

This emotional cocktail results in a recognizable mood. It’s not just “happy” or “sad”; it’s a complex state that dictates your pet’s priorities and purpose.

## Moods Drive Actions

A mood is not a passive status effect. It is an objective. It changes your pet’s very AI, overriding default behaviours with new, mood-specific goals.

- A **Protective** pet is a bodyguard. It will actively position itself between you and danger, its focus entirely on your safety.
- A **Playful** pet is a joyful troublemaker. It might chase after thrown items or pounce on butterflies, its attention captured by the promise of fun.
- A **Curious** pet is an explorer. It may wander off to investigate a strange noise or a new cave, its instinct to discover overriding its command to follow.
- A **Bonded** pet is a loyal shadow. It will stick closer than usual, orbit you while you work, and refuse to be left behind, its entire world shrunk to the space you occupy.

Each mood carries a set of these unique behaviours, making your pet feel alive, responsive, and sometimes, unpredictable.

## The Rhythm of Rest

You may notice that pets in the distance, or those who haven't been stimulated recently, appear calmer and less active. This is by design. To ensure your world feels alive without overwhelming it, your companions conserve their energy. Their complex behavioural systems quiet down when they are on the periphery, resting until you draw near or a new, important signal cuts through the noise. 

They are not offline. They are simply at peace, waiting for the next moment that matters.
