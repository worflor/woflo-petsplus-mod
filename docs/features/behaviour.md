## Pets Remember and Share Stories

Your pets don't just react to what they see — they **remember events and tell each other about them**.

When something interesting happens (campfires lit, treasures found, combat victories), pets remember:

- **What happened**
- **How big a deal it was** (minor event vs. major discovery)
- **How sure they are** (did they witness it firsthand or hear it from a friend?)
- **When it occurred**
- **How do they feel about it** (dictates tone)

Pets share these memories when they're hanging out together:

- **Group storytelling** — pack members swap stories during downtime (within 8.5 blocks)
- **Private whispers** — one-on-one exchanges when two pets cross paths (within 6 blocks)

Gossip shapes emotions secondhand. Hearing about a cozy campfire gathering might boost Sobremesa even if your pet wasn't there. Learning about a nearby threat increases Vigilance.

This creates a **pack memory** — your pets develop shared knowledge and experiences without you having to tell each one individually.

Emotions also spread between nearby pets through **contagion** — when one pet feels something strongly, packmates pick it up. This creates natural pack behavior where fear spreads or victory rallies everyone.

## Mood-Based AI

Each mood has associated AI goals that activate when that mood dominates.

- **Happy** → Follow owner closely, wag tail
- **Playful** → Chase items, bounce around
- **Curious** → Investigate blocks, wander toward new chunks
- **Bonded** → Orbit owner, refuse to leave their side
- **Calm** → Rest, find sunbeams, minimal movement
- **Passionate** → Charge toward objectives, high energy movement
- **Yūgen** → Stargazing behavior, contemplative sitting
- **Focused** → Lock onto tasks, ignore distractions
- **Sisu** → Push through obstacles, refuse to quit
- **Saudade** → Return to familiar locations, nostalgic circling
- **Protective** → Guard owner, position between threats
- **Restless** → Pace, circle, agitated movement
- **Afraid** → Flee from threats, stay behind owner
- **Angry** → Attack hostile targets, aggressive posture

Mood AI doesn't replace role abilities. It *layers on top*. A Guardian pet in Protective mood will prioritize defensive positioning even more aggressively.
