# Emotions: The Inner Palette

Behind every action and every mood, there is an inner world of feeling. Emotions are the vocabulary of your pet's soul, the raw colors that mix and blend to paint the portrait of their current state. This inner world is deep, with over 40 distinct emotions, but you don't need to track them. You just need to feel them.

*For how these emotions are triggered, see [Stimulus: The World Whispers](stimulus.md).*

## Roles Shape Feelings

A pet's [Role](roles.md) is more than a set of abilities; it is a core part of their personality that tunes their emotional landscape. Each role provides a unique lens on the world, amplifying some feelings while muting others.

- A **Support** is tuned for empathy, feeling a stronger pang of **Worried** when you're hurt and a deeper sense of **Content** when the pack is safe and sound.
- A **Guardian**'s heart beats with **Protectiveness**. They are predisposed to feel **Vigilant** and are quick to anger when their charge is threatened.
- An **Eclipsed**, touched by the void, might react to strange magic with a surge of **Curiosity** instead of fear, their emotions as alien as their powers.

This emotional tuning is what makes each role feel distinct. It’s not just what they do; it’s how they feel while doing it.

## The Nature of Feelings

Feelings are not static. They are fluid, adapting to your shared experiences. The tenth treat is never as exciting as the first, because pets, like people, get used to things. This makes new and rare experiences feel much more significant when they happen.

These feelings are also contagious. A pack that travels together feels together. One pet's fear can ripple through the group, and a shared victory can amplify everyone's pride. Ultimately, all these individual feelings are constantly being blended into the dominant **Mood** that drives your pet's behaviour.
