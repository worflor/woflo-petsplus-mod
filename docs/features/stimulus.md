# Stimulus: The World Whispers

Your pet is always listening. Not on a timer, not on a loop, but to the rhythm of the world itself. They are active observers, constantly taking in the moments that unfold around them and building an emotional understanding of their environment.

This system is about perception. It’s the spark that lights the fuse of every feeling your pet will ever have.

## Signals in the Noise

Think of the world as a place full of signals. Some are loud, some are quiet, but your pet notices them.

- **Direct Interactions:** A gentle hand, a favorite food, the sting of a mis-thrown snowball.
- **Combat:** The drawing of a bow, the clang of a sword, the cry of a monster, the pain of an ally.
- **The Environment:** The crackle of a campfire, the sudden darkness of a cave, the howl of wind on a mountaintop, the melody from a jukebox.
- **The Pack:** The presence of other companions, the return of their owner after a long journey, the shared victory over a powerful foe.

These are just a few of the hundreds of signals your pet is attuned to. They are the raw data of existence. But your pet doesn't just log these events—they interpret them.

## The Lens of Identity

A signal is meaningless without context, and your pet's identity provides that context. Their innate **[Nature](natures.md)** and chosen **[Role](roles.md)** act as a lens, coloring everything they perceive.

An arrow whistling past is just a sound. But to a pet with a **Guardian** role, it’s a threat to be intercepted. To a **Striker**, it’s a challenge to be met. To one born with a skittish **Nature**, it’s a terrifying event that signals imminent danger.

The world provides the stimulus; your pet’s soul provides the meaning.

This is where emotion begins. A signal, filtered through identity, creates a feeling. It might be a flicker of pride, a surge of protectiveness, or a pang of fear.
