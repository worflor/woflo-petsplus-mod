# Roles: The Core Identity

A role is your pet's purpose. It is the core of their identity, shaping not only what they do, but how they see the world and what they feel is important. When you choose a role, you are giving your pet a destiny. This choice will define their abilities, their priorities, and their part in your shared story.

While a pet's [Nature](natures.md) is its innate personality, its Role is its chosen profession. This identity is the primary lens through which your pet interprets the world, influencing its [emotions](emotions.md) and driving its [behaviour](behaviour.md). Changing a role is a significant decision. While their personality remains, their journey of progression, including levels and abilities, will begin anew.

## The Nine Roles

Each role offers a unique way for your pet to contribute. They unlock new abilities and passive effects as your bond deepens through the [leveling](leveling.md) journey.

### Guardian
**"I will keep you safe."**
A living shield and loyal bulwark. The Guardian is a stoic protector that instinctively puts itself in harm's way, redirecting damage meant for you and shrugging off blows that would fell a lesser companion.

### Striker
**"Point me at the problem."**
A relentless executioner. The Striker lives for the thrill of the hunt, growing stronger with every kill. It excels at finishing fights, creating openings, and rewarding an aggressive playstyle.

### Support
**"Rest for a moment, friend."**
A walking comfort zone. The Support is a nurturing presence that keeps the pack healthy and resilient. It provides healing auras, extends the effects of helpful potions, and cleanses ailments.

### Scout
**"I think something's over here!"**
A curious pathfinder. The Scout is an exploration specialist with a nose for treasure and a knack for spotting danger. It illuminates valuable resources and alerts you to hidden threats.

### Skyrider
**"The ground is merely a suggestion."**
A master of mobility that defies gravity. The Skyrider assists with vertical movement, negates fall damage, and uses the power of air and elevation to its advantage in combat.

### Enchantment-Bound
**"Your tools sing a powerful song."**
A quiet enabler that hums with arcane energy. This pet is attuned to the magic within your gear. It passively boosts tool efficiency, improves enchanting outcomes, and preserves durability.

### Cursed One
**"We burn bright, or not at all."**
A soul-bound glass cannon. This role creates an intense, dramatic bond with immense power at a terrible cost. The pet is exceptionally strong, but its life is permanently tethered to your own.

### Eepy Eeper
**"Nap time is sacred."**
A restful hearth spirit. This cozy companion turns any camp into a haven of tranquility. It amplifies the benefits of resting, provides passive regeneration, and makes downtime more restorative.

### Eclipsed
**"Marked for the void."**
A saboteur infused with ender magic. The Eclipsed is a master of battlefield control, branding targets to make them vulnerable and using void-powered tricks to disorient foes and assist allies.

## A Note on Progression

Each role has its own unique journey of growth. New abilities and stronger effects will unlock at key milestones in your pet's development. For more on how this progression works, see **[Leveling: The Shared Journey](leveling.md)**.
