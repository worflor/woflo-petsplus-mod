# Design Philosophy - woflo 2025 -

## Integration Without Separation

Pets+ follows Minecraft's core design language and natural behavior patterns. The goal is presence without disruption, depth without clutter, information without menus in your face.

Originally planned as server-side only. That proved overambitious. Server + client opens more possibilities, but the philosophy stays the same: integrate with what's there. Vanilla items, existing particles, natural feedback loops. No forced menus, no items for the sake of items.

Moods layer onto existing AI without replacing it. Playful wolves follow pack logic and bounce more. Angry cats sit when told and glare while doing it. Particle effects, sounds, action bar text when it matters.

The hard question: how does this fit into modpacks without feeling like a rock in a pool? JSON configs. The mod bends around others, adapts to different environments. You feel its presence, don't get overwhelmed by it, build experiences from it, and miss it when it's gone. That line takes work to find.

## Emergent, Not Scripted

Natures set baselines. Events shift emotions. Emotions form moods. Same wolf under different ownership develops differently. Kill near them, Pride rises. Die near them, Worry builds. Ignore them, Frustration grows.

No loyalty questlines. Loyalty emerges from combat, survival, protection. Systems create space for stories to happen.

## Flexible Foundation

I know how I like to play. But I also know that's unlike what others enjoy. The underlying systems are tuned for my version of "Vanilla Gameplay"—but the dials are exposed so others can tune it their way.

Competitive challenge, cozy companionship, high-risk play, death avoidance—playstyles vary wildly. The foundation supports that variance. Core mechanics shift when new ideas emerge, but the structure stays flexible.

Roles, abilities, emotions, moods, tributes, XP curves—all JSON. Rebalance numbers, adjust penalties, write better roles than the base mod includes. Do it without making a whole new mod. The systems are there, the configuration is open.

## Depth You Choose

Layers exist. Surface works fine on its own—pets level, abilities unlock. Dig deeper and patterns emerge. Emotional states, mood shifts, social dynamics, behavioral variance. Depth reveals itself to those who look, stays invisible to those who don't.

Ignorance isn't punished. Skip the complexity, pets still function. Optimize the numbers, systems support it. Notice the details, get rewarded for it. Critical information always surfaces. Everything else stays quiet until needed.

## Amplification Over Gates

Progression adds tools, doesn't lock basics. Early levels work, higher levels work better. Specialization exists, but nothing gets gated behind it. The mod enhances what players already do—doesn't create prerequisites for doing it.

No barriers. Just amplification.

## Moments Over Mechanics

Systems create opportunities, not cutscenes. Interactions happen because conditions align, not because scripts trigger. The memorable parts aren't features—they're what emerges from systems colliding.

But it's all code at the end. Math, algorithms, deterministic logic. The trick is slipping in subtle, non-resource-intensive variables—enough contextual awareness to make it believable without choking performance. And accepting the limits. Code can only create so much variation.

The real entropy comes from players. Their friends, servermates, enemies. How they treat their pets, when they fight, who they trust. That's the factor I can't control and have to rely on. Randomness exists where needed, but players are what make each experience actually unique.

Tracking exists for memory, not progression. When something noteworthy happens, the mod remembers it. Not to gate content, but to acknowledge the journey happened.
