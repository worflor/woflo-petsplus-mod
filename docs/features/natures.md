# Natures

Natures are the lasting mood that settles into a pet the moment it joins you. The story of that first meeting shapes how the pet moves, reacts, and cheers you on. You discover them by taming wanderers or by choreographing a birth.

## Two ways to meet a nature

Pets pull from different nature pools depending on how they arrive. Wild partners keep the instincts they learned outside your base. Newborns soak up whatever scene you build for them.

### Wild natures

Taming a stray locks in a climate-taught personality. Cold, temperate, and hot biomes each lend a different temperament:

* **Frisky:** Frozen homes create alert, playful scouts.
* **Feral:** Mild regions raise steady survivors.
* **Fierce:** Blistering zones forge bold guardians.

### Born natures

Breeding lets you stage set pieces. Weather, architecture, altitude, and even who is watching all weigh in on the final roll. Experiment with different cues and you will keep uncovering fresh combinations.

* **Radiant:** Daylight under an open sky.
* **Lunaris:** Nighttime with the moon in view.
* **Tempest:** Thunder rolling overhead.
* **Hearth:** Indoors among cozy blocks.
* **Infernal:** Deep in the Nether.
* **Abstract:** Seal both parents inside a pitch black one block pocket. The nature can appear for any bloodline, but every Unnatural parent you bring multiplies the odds.

These examples are only a starting point. Mix biomes, structures, light levels, crowd sizes, and redstone to see what else triggers.

## What natures do

A nature nudges stats and emotional weights without erasing the pet you met. Two pets with the same nature still land on slightly different rolls, so each friend keeps a personal spark.
