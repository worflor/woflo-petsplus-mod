# Natures: The Origin Story

A nature is the steady core of your pet’s personality—the mark left by how they entered your world. Roles decide what a pet does; nature sets how it feels while doing it. Pets gain their nature in one of two ways: taming them in the wild or raising them through a planned birth.

## Wild Natures: The Call of the Wild

Taming a stray locks in whatever vibe the biome taught it.

* **Frisky:** Cold homes breed quick, alert partners.
* **Feral:** Temperate lands raise balanced survivors.
* **Fierce:** Hot climates forge pets with heat-hardened grit.

## Born Natures: A Product of Circumstance

Breeding lets you script stranger stories. The room, the weather, even who’s watching can tip the scales toward a specific nature.

* **Radiant:** Deliver under bright daylight.
* **Lunaris:** Time the birth for the deep of night—moon phase included.
* **Tempest:** Wait for a thunderstorm.
* **Hearth:** Keep it indoors among cozy blocks.
* **Infernal:** Brave the Nether’s heat.
* **Abstract:** Seal both parents in a pitch-black 1×1×1 pocket. The nature can appear on any bloodline, but each Unnatural parent you bring multiplies the odds.

There are many more rituals to uncover. Play with location, weather, time, and company to see which story sticks.

## What Natures Do

Natures nudge stats and emotions without rewriting your pet. A Fierce companion may flare up faster; a Frisky one stays playful. Even pets who share a nature land on slightly different numbers, so every partner keeps a personal spark.
