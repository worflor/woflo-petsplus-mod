# Natures

Natures are permanent personality and stat traits assigned to your pet based on where and how they joined you. Kind of like a foundational "vibe" that shapes how your pet experiences the Minecraft World™️.

## Two Paths, Two Types

Pets can acquire natures in one of two ways: **taming** or **breeding**. The method determines which nature pool they roll from.

### Wild Natures

Tamed pets receive one of three climate-based natures. These reflect the survival instincts developed in the wild before you showed up.

- **Frisky** — Cold climates (temperature ≤ 0.3)  
  Quick, alert, and playful. Adapted to frozen tundras and icy peaks.

- **Feral** — Neutral climates (0.3 < temperature < 1.0)  
  Balanced and resourceful. The default survivor of temperate zones.

- **Fierce** — Hot climates (temperature ≥ 1.0)  
  Aggressive and resilient. Forged in deserts and scorching wastelands.

Wild natures are simple by design. You can't control where animals spawn, so these natures don't punish you for taming convenience. They're functional, grounded, and thematically consistent with the "already developed adult" you're befriending.

### Born Natures

Bred pets roll for born natures, which are influenced by the specific circumstances at the moment of birth. These are rare, controllable, and significantly more varied.

Born natures require intentional setup. Want a Lunaris pet? Plan a twilight or midnight birth beneath open sky and let the stars decide their sign. Chasing Infernal? Take your breeding pair into the Nether. These conditions encourage exploration, pack migration, and environmental storytelling.

**Available Born Natures:**

- **Radiant** — Daytime, open sky, clear weather
- **Lunaris**: Night, dusk, or dawn; under open sky; grants a secret star sign
- **Homestead** — Near farms and settlements
- **Hearth** — Indoors with cozy blocks nearby
- **Gloom** — Indoors, low light, no valuable blocks
- **Festival** — 3+ nearby pets or players
- **Solace** — Birthed in solitude (no nearby players/pets)
- **Verdant** — Lush foliage present
- **Frosty** — Snowy biome conditions
- **Tempest** — Rainy or thundering weather
- **Summit** — Height ≥ 100, open sky
- **Tidal** — Fully submerged in ocean biome
- **Mire** — Swamp biome or near mud/mangrove
- **Blossom** — Cherry Grove biome
- **Molten** — Near lava or magma blocks
- **Gilded** — Valuable ores nearby
- **Clockwork** — Near redstone machinery
- **Sentinel** — Post-combat with organized, well-stocked storage
- **Scrappy** — Post-combat with disorganized, cluttered storage
- **Infernal** — The Nether
- **Relic** — Near major structures (strongholds, ruins)
- **Ceramic** — Near Trial Ruins
- **Mycelial** — Mushroom Fields biome
- **Echoed** — Deep Dark biome
- **Otherworldly** — Any dimension besides Overworld/Nether
- **Unnatural** — Breeder owns neither parent

## Why the Split?

The separation between wild and born natures is intentional.

**Taming** is about accessibility. You find an animal, you tame it.

**Breeding** is about investment. You're engineering the birth conditions, migrating your pack to dangerous or distant biomes, and praying nothing bad happens. This is where the game rewards planning, exploration, and pack-building.

Born natures are about imprinting. The circumstances at birth leave a mystical mark on the newborn. Wild natures are survival traits. The adult animal has already adapted to its environment; you just befriended it.

## What Do Natures Actually Do?

Each nature provides minor stat adjustments and shifts emotional tendencies. These are subtle modifiers that add personality without being heavy-handed.

Every nature has a base template, but **each individual pet rolls slight variations**. Two Frisky wolves won't be identical. One might have slightly higher speed, another might lean harder into playfulness. The rolls use bell curves with roughly ±15% variance, creating natural diversity within each nature.

The system tracks:

- **Stat bonuses** — minor boosts to health, speed, attack, defense, etc.
- **Emotional profile** — which emotions (major/minor/quirk) are amplified
- **Behavioral multipliers** — volatility, resilience, contagion, guard tendencies

For example:

- A **Frisky** pet might lean slightly toward playful emotions
- A **Blossom** pet has contageous emotions, tugging nearby attention
- A **Festival** pet greatly prefers crowds over isolation
- A **Solace** pet prefers isolation over crowds
- A **Scrappy** pet feels the need to prove itself 
- A **Lunaris** pet is different depending on when it became Lunaris. Each zodiac sign has a bespoke title:
  - **Fire Signs** — Aries → *Lunaris Vanguard*, Leo → *Solara Lunaris*, Sagittarius → *Zenith Lunaris*
- **Earth Signs** — Taurus → *Bulwark Lunaris*, Virgo → *Calibra Lunaris*, Capricorn → *Lunaris Apex*
- **Air Signs** — Gemini → *Syzygy Lunaris*, Libra → *Lunaris Equinox*, Aquarius → *Cascade Lunaris*
  - **Water Signs** — Cancer → *Lunaris Haven*, Scorpio → *Vesper Lunaris*, Pisces → *Eidolon Lunaris*

## Final Notes

- Natures are **permanent**. You can't reroll or change them.
- Each pet gets **exactly one** nature.
- If multiple natures could apply, one is chosen randomly using the pet's RNG calculator.
