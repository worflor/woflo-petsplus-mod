# Natures

Natures are permanent personality traits assigned to your pet based on where and how they joined you. Think of them as the foundational "vibe" that shapes how your pet experiences the world.

## Two Paths, Two Types

Pets can acquire natures in one of two ways: **taming** or **breeding**. The method determines which nature pool they roll from.

### Wild Natures

Tamed pets receive one of three climate-based natures. These reflect the survival instincts developed in the wild before you showed up.

- **Frisky** — Cold climates (temperature ≤ 0.3)  
  Quick, alert, and playful. Adapted to frozen tundras and icy peaks.

- **Feral** — Neutral climates (0.3 < temperature < 1.0)  
  Balanced and resourceful. The default survivor of temperate zones.

- **Fierce** — Hot climates (temperature ≥ 1.0)  
  Aggressive and resilient. Forged in deserts and scorching wastelands.

Wild natures are simple by design. You can't control where animals spawn, so these natures don't punish you for taming convenience. They're functional, grounded, and thematically consistent with the "already developed adult" you're befriending.

### Born Natures

Bred pets roll for born natures, which are influenced by the specific circumstances at the moment of birth. These are rare, controllable, and significantly more varied.

Born natures require intentional setup. Want a Nocturne pet? Wait for a full moon and breed under open sky. Chasing Infernal? Take your breeding pair into the Nether. These conditions encourage exploration, pack migration, and environmental storytelling.

**Available Born Natures:**

- **Radiant** — Daytime, open sky, clear weather
- **Nocturne** — Nighttime, full moon, open sky
- **Tempest** — Rainy or thundering weather
- **Hearth** — Indoors with cozy blocks nearby
- **Solace** — Birthed in solitude (no nearby players/pets)
- **Festival** — 3+ nearby pets or players
- **Infernal** — The Nether
- **Otherworldly** — Any dimension besides Overworld/Nether
- **Echoed** — Deep Dark biome
- **Mycelial** — Mushroom Fields biome
- **Gilded** — Valuable ores nearby
- **Gloom** — Indoors, low light, no valuable blocks
- **Verdant** — Lush foliage present
- **Summit** — Height ≥ 100, open sky
- **Tidal** — Fully submerged in ocean biome
- **Molten** — Near lava or magma blocks
- **Frosty** — Snowy biome conditions
- **Mire** — Swamp biome or near mud/mangrove
- **Relic** — Near major structures (strongholds, ruins)
- **Unnatural** — Breeder owns neither parent

## Why the Split?

The separation between wild and born natures is intentional.

**Taming** is about accessibility. You find an animal, you tame it, you get a functional companion with climate-appropriate flavor. No pressure, no setup required.

**Breeding** is about investment. You're engineering the birth conditions, migrating your pack to dangerous or distant biomes, and creating something unique. This is where the game rewards planning, exploration, and pack-building behavior.

Born natures are imprinting moments. The circumstances at birth leave a mystical mark on the newborn. Wild natures are survival traits. The adult animal has already adapted to its environment.

Nature vs nurture as a game mechanic.

## What Do Natures Actually Do?

Each nature provides minor stat adjustments and shifts emotional tendencies. These are subtle modifiers that add personality without being heavy-handed.

Every nature has a base template, but **each individual pet rolls slight variations**. Two Frisky wolves won't be identical. One might have slightly higher speed, another might lean harder into playfulness. The rolls use bell curves with roughly ±15% variance, creating natural diversity within each nature.

The system tracks:

- **Stat bonuses** — minor boosts to health, speed, attack, defense, etc.
- **Emotional profile** — which emotions (major/minor/quirk) are amplified
- **Behavioral multipliers** — volatility, resilience, contagion, guard tendencies

For example:

- A **Frisky** pet might lean slightly toward playful emotions
- A **Solace** pet could have heightened resilience when alone
- An **Infernal** pet may show more aggression or protectiveness

The specifics of stat bonuses and emotional weights aren't critical to understand upfront. What matters is that natures give your pet a consistent behavioral flavor that fits their origin story. The variance ensures no two pets feel exactly the same, even with the same nature.

## Checking Your Pet's Nature

You can view your pet's nature by inspecting them. Wild natures display as *"Hardened by [climate]"* while born natures show *"Touched by fate at birth"* (or similar flavor text).

## Final Notes

- Natures are **permanent**. You can't reroll or change them.
- Each pet gets **exactly one** nature.
- Born pets will **never** roll wild natures. Tamed pets will **never** roll born natures.
- If multiple born natures could apply, one is chosen randomly using the pet's internal RNG.

Natures aren't meant to be min-maxed. They're flavor, identity, and a small mechanical nudge that ties your pet to where they came from.
