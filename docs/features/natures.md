# Natures: The Origin Story

A nature is the unchangeable core of your pet's personality, the origin story that defines its foundational-vibe. It is an imprint left by the circumstances of their birth or taming, a permanent set of quirks and tendencies that makes your pet unique. While their [Role](roles.md) is their chosen profession, their Nature is the bedrock of who they are.

There are two paths through which a pet can gain a nature: being tamed from the wild or being bred under specific conditions.

## Wild Natures: The Call of the Wild

A pet tamed in the wild receives a nature that reflects the environment where it grew up. These natures are a product of survival, shaped by the climate of their home biome.

*   **Frisky:** Found in cold climates. These pets are quick, alert, and adapted to the challenges of frozen landscapes.
*   **Feral:** Found in temperate climates. Balanced and resourceful, these are the quintessential survivors.
*   **Fierce:** Found in hot climates. Resilient and aggressive, these pets are forged by the heat of deserts and savannas.

## Born Natures: A Product of Circumstance

A pet born through breeding has the potential for a much wider, more mystical range of natures. These are not random. They are a direct result of the specific conditions at the moment of their birth. This is where you, as a caretaker, can influence destiny.

Creating the right environment for a specific nature requires planning and effort. The world itself imprints upon the newborn.

*   Want a **Radiant** pet? Ensure it is born under the clear light of day.
*   Seeking a **Lunaris** pet? Plan the birth for the deep of night. The phase of the moon will even grant it a secret astrological sign, a deeper layer of personality.
*   A **Tempest** nature requires the child to be born during a raging storm.
*   A **Hearth** nature can only be achieved indoors, surrounded by cozy materials.
*   An **Infernal** nature can only be forged in the oppressive heat of the Nether.

There are over a dozen of these special, born natures to discover. Each requires a unique set of environmental conditions related to location, weather, time of day, or even the social situation of the birth. Experiment with different setups to see what origin stories you can create.

## What Natures Do

A nature provides subtle shifts to a pet's stats and emotional tendencies. A Fierce pet might be quicker to anger, while a Frisky one might be more playful. These are not massive gameplay buffs but personality quirks that make each pet feel like an individual. Even two pets with the same nature will have slight variations, ensuring no two companions are ever truly identical.
