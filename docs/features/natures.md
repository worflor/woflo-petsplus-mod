# Natures

Natures are the lasting mood that settles into a pet the moment it joins you. The story of that first meeting shapes how the pet moves, reacts, and cheers you on. You discover them by taming wanderers or by choreographing a birth.

## Two ways to meet a nature

Pets pull from different nature pools depending on how they arrive. Wild partners keep the instincts they learned outside your base. Newborns soak up whatever scene you build for them.

### Wild natures

Taming a stray locks in a climate-taught personality. Cold, temperate, and hot biomes each lend a different temperament:

* **Frisky:** Frozen homes create alert, playful scouts.
* **Feral:** Mild regions raise steady survivors.
* **Fierce:** Blistering zones forge bold guardians.

### Born natures

Breeding lets you stage set pieces. Weather, architecture, altitude, storage, crowds, and even contraptions all weigh in on the roll.

* **Radiant:** Daylight under an open sky with clear weather.
* **Lunaris:** Overworld nights with the moon overhead and the sky in view.
* **Homestead:** Any build that shows clear homestead touches.
* **Hearth:** Indoors while cozy blocks surround the egg.
* **Tempest:** Rain or thunder crashing through the area.
* **Solace:** No nearby players or pets sharing the room.
* **Festival:** A lively audience of players or pets cheering nearby.
* **Otherworldly:** Births that finish outside both the Overworld and the Nether.
* **Infernal:** The molten pressure of the Nether itself.
* **Echoed:** Deep Dark biomes steeped in sculk.
* **Mycelial:** Mushroom fields with their gentle glow.
* **Gilded:** Ores stacked around the nest.
* **Gloom:** Indoors, nearly dark, and without rich ores to break the mood.
* **Verdant:** Lush greenery within arm's reach.
* **Summit:** High altitude perches with open sky.
* **Tidal:** Fully submerged ocean births.
* **Molten:** Lava or magma radiating heat nearby.
* **Frosty:** Snowfall, powder snow, or frigid storms wrapping the scene.
* **Mire:** Muddy mangrove or swamp surroundings.
* **Relic:** Major structures watching over the cradle.
* **Ceramic:** Active dig sites, decorated pots, or trial chambers with clear weather.
* **Blossom:** Cherry blooms or lush meadows open to the sun.
* **Clockwork:** Redstone networks humming inside a sheltered build.
* **Sentinel:** Post-battle rooms stocked with organized gear and storage.
* **Scrappy:** Post-battle chaos with messy or understocked storage.
* **Unnatural:** Both parents arrive wild and unclaimed.
* **Abstract:** Seal the egg inside a pitch black one block pocket with no water, witnesses, or light leaks. The nature can surface for any lineage, and every Unnatural parent sharply boosts the odds.

That lineup covers every nature bundled with PetsPlus. Mix biomes, structures, light levels, crowds, and redstone to see how the rules collide.

## What natures do

A nature nudges stats and emotional weights without erasing the pet you met. Two pets with the same nature still land on slightly different rolls, so each friend keeps a personal spark.
