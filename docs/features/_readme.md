The systems are designed to be deep but intuitive. You are not expected to memorize them. Instead, this guide is here for you when you notice a curious behaviour and want to understand the "why" behind it.

## Core Concepts

*   **[Stimulus: Responding to the World](stimulus.md)**
    How your pet perceives the world, and how its identity gives meaning to the events it observes.

*   **[Behaviour: Interacting with the World](behaviour.md)**
    How your pet's inner feelings translate into moods and outward actions.

*   **[Emotions: Inner experiences](emotions.md)**
    The vast spectrum of feelings that make up your pet's inner world.

*   **[Roles: What it do](roles.md)**
    How a chosen Role gives your pet a purpose and a unique way of interacting with the world.

*   **[Leveling: Where we go](leveling.md)**
    The path of growth that you and your pet walk together, strengthening your bond and unlocking new potential.

*   **[Natures: No, not like Pok√©mon](natures.md)**
    The unchangeable core of your pet's personality, imprinted by the circumstances of its birth or taming.

*   **[Advancements](advancements.md)**
    A list of special milestones you can achieve on your journey with your companions.
