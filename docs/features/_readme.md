# Pets+ Docs (ig)

Welcome to the feature documentation for PetsPlus. This is not a manual, but a field guide. It is designed to give you a deeper appreciation for the living, breathing companions that this mod brings to your world.

The systems are designed to be deep but intuitive. You are not expected to memorize them. Instead, this guide is here for you when you notice a curious behaviour and want to understand the "why" behind it.

## Core Concepts
