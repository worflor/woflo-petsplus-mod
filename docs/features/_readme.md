Unfortunately, your *real pets* have *real emotions*. 

## Core Concepts

*   **[Emotions: Inner experiences](emotions.md)**
    The vast spectrum of feelings that make up your pet's inner world.

    Scaling with level, effecting the core identity, choose a role for your pet to equip them with a purpose.

*   **[Leveling: Where we go](leveling.md)**
    The path of growth that you and your pet walk together, strengthening your bond and unlocking new potential.

*   **[Natures: No, not like Pok√©mon](natures.md)**

## Future Considerations
Things I have in mind for the future.

*   **Deeper Mob Intergration:** Including mechanics like Sniffer courting.
*   **Wellbeing Profile:** A more fleshed-out system for understanding your pet's overall state.
*   **Expansion Modules:**
    *   **Neurodivergence:** Utilizing the core systems to introduce traits inspired by autism, ADHD, OCD, and bipolar disorder.
    *   **More Nature Packs:** General expansions to add even more variety to pet origins.
