### What you'll notice
- Natures act as the personality/vibe, emotions flare in the moment, moods linger in the background.
- Roles and little unlocks grow as you adventure, explore, and keep pets close.
- Memories and stories are tracked. Not for progression, but for immersion.

Curious how each layer fits together? The [feature docs](docs/features/_readme.md) is your friend.

2. Drop it into your Fabric `mods/` folder with Fabric API.

### Tweak It!
