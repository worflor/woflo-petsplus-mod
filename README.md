### What you'll notice
- Realtime fluctuations in your pet's mood; shifting through the stimulus its exposed to throughout its environment and interactions.
- Natures act like baseline *personalities*, adding quirks to your pets moods and stats.
- Levels unlocks grow as you adventure, explore, and keep pets close.
- Roles allow your pet to fulfill... roles!
- Memories and stories are tracked.

Curious how each layer fits together? The [feature docs](docs/features/_readme.md) is your friend.

### Play It!
1. Download the latest jar file. 
2. Drop it into your `mods/` folder along with the Fabric API.
3. Launch and enjoy.

### Tweak It!
- All of the personalities, moods, roles, and triggers live in datapacks and configs, ready to remix.
- Ship tweaks with your pack or server so everyone shares the same vibe.

### Build It!
note: i prefer **idea suggestions** over *'code contributions'*. If your idea is well thought out, credit(s) will be attributed. rejection of ideas/code for any reason is fine; i'm picky. the better the documentation/reasoning, higher liklihood of addition.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/woflo-dev/petsplus.git
cd petsplus
./gradlew build
```
