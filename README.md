## New Friends
The following entities are now tamable:
1. Frogs with slimeballs
2. Rabbits with carrots
3. Turtles with seagrass

### Pet Trading!
Make your unwanted regrets someone else's problem! Sneak right clicking another player while your pet is on a leash, transfers the leash to the other player; trading ownership in the process. The pet will remember this...

### being considered
- Phantoms via Trust*
- tiny slimes and tiny magma cubes
- Camels
- Llamas
- Fully taming foxes
- Every base passive mob via Trust* [ add emotions to all passive mobs ]

### Unimplimented 
- Sniffers via a special 'Courting' system/mini-game



### unimplemented yet
1. Nuzlocke / Hardcore mode - Each player can only tame one of each entity type per save. Or, locked to one per biome.
2. Peaceful / Easy mode - Pets enter a 'downed' state before dying, allowing the player time to reverse a mistake.



## Performance
All compute heavy tasks are done asynchronously using background threads.
