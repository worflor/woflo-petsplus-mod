# Pets+ dev-0.86-in-the-background (Pets Plus)
A standalone style Minecraft mod that expands tames and trusted mobs to add new twists on vanilla mechanics. 


## Pet Roles, Levelling, and Natures
Each role has a unique set of abilities, and can be applied to *any* tamable/trustable entity. *So MaNY wAcKy CoMbInAtiOnS*!

1. **Guardian** — a loyal shield that steps between you and the world. It absorbs punishment for you and steadies you against knockbacks and volleys.
2. **Striker** — a closer with a taste for last hits. Empowering it's owner while dealing devestating blows to hurting hostiles.
3. **Support** — a cozy caretaker that keeps you going longer. It makes your brews and buffs last longer and shares helpful auras among allies.
4. **Scout** — eyes like lanterns, pockets for days. It lights up the first threat and coaxes nearby loot and XP your way.
5. **Skyrider** — wind at your back, sky in your stride. It softens falls and can pop enemies into the air with your strikes.
6. **Enchantment-Bound** — your gear’s echo, humming with second chances. It extends work-speed surges and nudges drop luck in your favor.
7. **Cursed One** — a beautiful bad omen that turns fear into leverage. Like a curse of vanishing, this pet is tied to your soul. Die, and it dies.
8. **Eepy Eeper** — a cozy buddy that rewards slowing down. Let it rest and a quiet healing bubble blooms around you.
9. **Eclipsed** — void-kissed mischief that paints targets for ruin. It brands enemies, pings nearby lurkers, and allows mobile ender chest access.

Your pet shares your experience and grows alongside you. Feature levels (3, 7, 12, 17, 23, 27) unlock new abilities and bonuses. At tribute gates, offer a token to continue growing:
- **Level 10 →** Gold Ingot  
- **Level 20 →** Diamond  
- **Level 30 →** Netherite Ingot

Pets also come with distinct natures based on the conditions found when being tamed or born.
